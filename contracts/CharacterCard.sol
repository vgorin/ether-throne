/**
 * @notice Character card is unique tradable entity. Non-fungible.
 *      We will call "character card" also just "token" or "card token"
 * @dev Card is an ERC721 non-fungible token, which maps Card ID (Token ID),
 *      a number in range 1..5000 to a set of card properties -
 *      attributes (mostly immutable by their nature) and state variables (mutable)
 * @dev A card token supports minting but not burning, it cannot be destroyed
 * @dev ERC20-compatibility: full ERC20 compatibility with security limitation for transfers:
 *      `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions support sending only entire balance
 *      (`n = balanceOf(owner)`) by default; this behavior can be controlled using
 *      `ERC20_INSECURE_TRANSFERS` feature flag
 * @dev ERC721-compatibility: partial
 *      Note: ERC721 is still a draft at the moment of writing this smart contract,
 *      therefore implementing this "standard" fully doesn't make any sense
